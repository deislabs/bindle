# Label Specification

A _label_ (`label.toml`) contains metadata about a box. It is in TOML format, and is considered immutable once stored.

```toml
sha256 = "5b992e90b71d5fadab3cd3777230ef370df75f5b..."
mediaType = "application/x-javascript"
name = "foo.js"
size = 248098

[annotations]
key1 = "value 1"

[metadata.wasm]
# These fields are illustrative only
runtime = "wasmtime-v1.2.3"
dependencies = ["foo-v1.0.0", "bar-v2.3.4"]
```

## Top Level Fields

The top-level fields describe the `parcel.dat` content of this parcel.

- `sha256` is the SHA2-256 hash of the `parcel.dat` data (REQUIRED)
- `mediaType` is the media type (MIME type) of the parcel's data (REQUIRED)
- `name` is a recommended filename for the parcel data (OPTIONAL)
- `size` is the size in bytes of the parcel data (REQUIRED)
- `sha512` is the SHA2-512 hash of the parcel data (Not yet supported)

## The `metadata` Section

The `metadata` section provides a location for storing additional details about the parcel. Typically this is specific to media types or target consumers.

Metadata sections are string/object maps.

```toml
[metadata.NAME]
property1 = "foo"
property2 = "bar"
```
